How to run this notebook:

To create this notebook, I used Anaconda version 2.1.0 with a Python 3.9.16 version.
The installed libraries (apart from the default that come from a Conda environment) were

<li>Pandas
<li>Numpy
<li>Seaborn
<li>Scikit-learn
<li>category_encoders
<li>XGBoost

For a more detailed requirements list, see requirements.txt, however, keep in mind that a lot of the packages in that file come by default in Conda.
